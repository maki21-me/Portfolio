                      Hi, I'm a passionate and driven <strong>Software Engineering</strong> student, currently studying at university since 2023. From the moment I began learning software engineering through formal education and self-study, I discovered a deep love for the field. I find it incredibly fascinating and rewarding to solve problems through technology, and I believe that software engineering holds the <strong>key</strong> to addressing many challenges in our lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I'm excited about the journey ahead, constantly pushing myself to grow as a coder and develop creative solutions. I aspire to become not just a skilled programmer but also a problem solver who makes a positive impact on society. Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, building projects, and continuously learning to sharpen my skills. My goal is to evolve into a confident and smart developer, contributing to meaningful innovations and inspiring others along the way.
